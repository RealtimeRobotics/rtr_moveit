RapidPlan
=========

*RapidPlan* is a roadmap-based planning framework by `Realtime Robotics <https://rtr.ai/>`_ that allows high frequency collision checking and planning using a dedicated FPGA board, the *Motion Planning Accelerator (MPA)*.
The MPA - initialized with a precomputed roadmap - can process point cloud sensor input or other occupancy data to compute all collisions with roadmap edges in parallel.
Solving the planning problem is then a simple shortest path search in the residual roadmap graph.
Depending on the roadmap density these steps can be computed with a frequency of up to 1000hz, making *RapidPlan* excel in online trajectory validation and replanning applications.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install the `RapidPlan` toolkit and generate roadmap files following the instructions on https://rtr.ai/support
2. Install the ``rtr_moveit`` package:

   ``apt install ros-kinetic-rtr_moveit``

3. Modify_ the planning pipeline to use the RTRPlanner
4. Configure_ planner and roadmap parameters

The rtr_moveit plugin
---------------------
The ``rtr_moveit`` plugin integrates the *RapidPlan* interfaces into the planning pipeline and supports common ``MotionPlanRequest`` messages.
Goal states can be defined as arbitrary combinations of Joint-, Position- and Orientation constraints.
Since start and goal states are unlikely to be part of the roadmap the plugin attempts to solve for nearby state candidates and connect the endings afterwards.
This is done by linear interpolation and collision checking using the planning scene in *MoveIt!*.
The allowed distance of start and goal state candidates is defined by the parameter ``allowed_joint_distance`` and ``allowed_position_distance``.
The waypoint distance that should be used for collision checking in the planning scene is defined by ``max_waypoint_distance``.
RapidPlan also supports solving for multiple goal states at the same time, the maximum number is defined by ``max_goal_states``.

There are two supported types of occupancy data that can be used for collision checking using the MPA.
By default the collision objects in the planning scene are converted into a Voxel grid that is supported by the *RapidPlan* interface.
Alternatively, the plugin can subscribe to a point cloud topic and directly forward current sensor data which naturally is much more time efficient.
Occupancy data type and point cloud topics are configured using the parameters ``occupancy_source`` and ``pcl_topic``.

The currently loaded roadmap, volume region, solution path and collisions can be visualized by setting ``enable_visualization`` to *'true'*.

Setup the plugin
----------------

You need a working *MoveIt!* setup which we reference from now on with ``<your_moveit_setup>``.
Make sure to replace all references with the actual package name.

Create a file ``<your_moveit_setup>/launch/rtr_planning_pipeline.launch.xml`` with the following content::

  <launch>
    <!-- RapidPlan Plugin for MoveIt! -->
    <arg name="planning_plugin" value="rtr_moveit/RTRPlanner" />
  
    <!-- The request adapters (plugins) used when planning with RapidPlan. ORDER MATTERS -->
    <arg name="planning_adapters" value="default_planner_request_adapters/AddTimeParameterization
  				       default_planner_request_adapters/FixWorkspaceBounds
  				       default_planner_request_adapters/FixStartStateBounds
  				       default_planner_request_adapters/FixStartStateCollision
  				       default_planner_request_adapters/FixStartStatePathConstraints" />
  
    <arg name="start_state_max_bounds_error" value="0.1" />
    <param name="planning_plugin" value="$(arg planning_plugin)" />
    <param name="request_adapters" value="$(arg planning_adapters)" />
    <param name="start_state_max_bounds_error" value="$(arg start_state_max_bounds_error)" />
  
    <!-- Load the planner params -->
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find <your_moveit_setup>)/config/rtr_planning.yaml"/>
  </launch>


Change the ``move_group`` parameter ``pipeline`` in your ``move_group.launch`` to ``rtr`` like below so that the new pipeline launch file is used::

  ...

  <!-- Planning Functionality -->
  <include ns="move_group" file="$(find <your_moveit_setup>)/launch/planning_pipeline.launch.xml">
    <arg name="pipeline" value="rtr" />
  </include>

  ...

Create the file ``<your_moveit_setup>/config/rtr_planning_config.yaml`` and configure roadmap and planner parameters.
You can use this_ template and follow the instructions below for adding your own generated roadmaps.

Planner Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Planner parameters are defined under the namespace ``move_group/planner_config``.

**rapidplan_interface_enabled** (bool) - Allows disabling collision checks using the MPA for testing.

**allowed_joint_distance** (float) - Absolute joint distance tolerance for start and goal states.

**allowed_position_distance** (float) -  *(not yet implemented)* Absolute tool position tolerance for start and goal states in meter.

**allowed_orientation_distance** (float) - *(not yet implemented)* Absolute tool orientation tolerance for start and goal states in rad.

**max_waypoint_distance** (float) - Absolute joint distance for collision checking in the planning scene when connecting start and goal states.

**max_goal_states** (int) - The maximum number of roadmap states to sample from goal constraints for planning.

**visualization_enabled** (bool, default=false) - Toggles visualization of roadmap and solutions in RViz.

**occupancy_source** (string, default= `"PLANNING_SCENE"`) - Sets the type of occupancy data to use, either `"PLANNING_SCENE"` or `"POINT_CLOUD"`.

**pcl_topic** (string) - If ``occupancy_source`` is set to `"POINT_CLOUD"` this is the ROS topic to subscribe for sensor data.


.. _Configure:

Roadmap Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A roadmap is represented by a single \*.og file and a name identifier.
The roadmap file path is composed by the package path, the directory in the package and the file name.
Default package and directory can be set using the parameters ``default/roadmaps_package`` and ``default/roadmaps_directory``.
The default file name is the name of the roadmap.

Each group should have a default roadmap name specified under ``group/default_roadmap``.
Further roadmaps can be added as a list under ``group/roadmaps``.

Roadmaps where the files should not be resolved from the defaults can be configured under ``roadmaps``.
Here each roadmap can have specific entries for ``filename,`` ``package`` or ``directory`` that overwrite the defaults.
The same pattern can be used when adding additional parameters later.
This is also useful for creating aliases of the same roadmap with different configurations.

A valid roadmap configuration inside the ``rtr_planning.yaml`` config has the following pattern::

  roadmaps:
    roadmap_1:
      filename: another_filename
      directory: directory_B
    roadmap_2:
      package: package_B
  
  default:
    roadmaps_package: package_A
    roadmaps_directory: directory_A
  
  group:
    default_roadmap: roadmap_1
    roadmaps:
    - roadmap_2
    - roadmap_3

The parameter lookup iterates over all roadmap names of each group and loads all roadmap files that can be found.
This makes the use of either ``default`` or ``roadmaps`` optional.
Groups without any valid roadmaps are not available for planning.
If no group with a valid roadmap was found the plugin initialization fails with an error.
The example above would resolve to the following roadmap paths: 

  - roadmap_1: <package_A>/directory_B/another_filename.og
  - roadmap_2: <package_B>/directory_A/roadmap_2.og
  - roadmap_3: <package_A>/directory_A/roadmap_3.og
